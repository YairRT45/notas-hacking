Our flag printing service has started glitching!
`$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 53072`

Hints:
1. ASCII is one of the most common encodings used in programming
2. We know that the glitch output is valid Python, somehow!
3. Press Ctrl and c on your keyboard to close your connection and return to the command prompt.

## SoluciÃ³n 1:
Con python y netcar:
